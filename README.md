# An implementation of Conway's Game of Life

Written to serve as the basis for a JavaScript
[Code Kata](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_\(programming\)).

See it [running](http://tkareine.github.com/game_of_life/example/index.html).

If you want to do the Kata, please do not search for the implementation of the
missing functionality. Try to solve it by yourself first.
